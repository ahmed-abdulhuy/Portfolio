    "brief": "In my graduation project we built a deep neural network to compensate for the bad GPS signal-to-noise ratio. We bypassed the current state-of-the-art by 6.5%. This task is usually referred to as cross-view geo-localization in scientific literature. My team worked on a geo-localization system based on matching a query ground image with a set of aerial images with deep learning. We created a new benchmark dataset that includes temporal context information about the ground trajectories which target our solution. We used the Google Maps Static API to collect the satellite images in our dataset. Our research paper is in the review process to get published in the MDPI's Sensors Journal. The team is mentored by Prof. Mohammed Elhenawy from QUT University."
